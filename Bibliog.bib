abstract="Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in low and middle income countries. Medical management is the mainstay of therapy to prevent recurrence of stroke. Current estimates are that only 1 in 6 patients have perfect adherence to medication schedules. Using SMS (Short Messaging Service) as reminders to take medicines have been used previously for diseases such as diabetes and HIV with moderate success. We aim to explore the effectiveness and acceptability of SMS in increasing adherence to medications in patients with stroke.",

abstract = {Self-adaptive systems are fed with contextual information from the environments in which the systems operate,from within themselves, and from the users. Traditional self-adaptive systems research has focused on inputs of systems performance, resources, exception, and error recovery that drive systems' reaction to their environments. The intelligent ability ofthese self-adaptive systems is impoverished without knowledge ofa user's covert attention (thoughts, emotions, feelings). As a result, it is difficult to build effective systems that anticipate and react to users' needs as projected by covert behavior. This paperpresents the preliminary research results on capturing users'intention through neural input, and in reaction, commanding actions from software systems (e.g., load an application) based on human intention. Further, systems can self-adapt and refine their behaviors driven by such human covert behavior. The long-term research goal is to incorporate and synergize human neural input.Thus establishing software systems with a self-adaptive capability to "feel" and "anticipate" users intentions and put the human in the loop.},

        abstract = {Previous studies argue that visual elements possess the power of persuasion and contribute in persuading the end users. However, not much attention has been given in assessing the implementation of persuasive techniques in website{\textquoteright}s visual design. Based on Cialdini{\textquoteright}s six persuasion techniques, this paper reviews the current state of utilising the techniques in tourism website design. Issues related to the lacking of persuasive design are highlighted. This paper also discusses, in the context of tourism, the possible visual cues representing the techniques of reciprocation, commitment and consistency, social proof, liking, authority and scarcity. A comparison is made between information-driven and profit-driven websites. The outcome of the review confirms that the design of tourism websites is mostly focusing on facilitating communication with the web users and emphasis more in providing favourable imagery and information to attract their attention. However, it is discovered that even though most persuasion principles are present, they are still under-utilised. Moreover, credibility remains as a major issue as less evidence of visual elements that emphasis trust can be found in the design. In addition to the reviews and discussion, this paper also presents a conceptual framework of persuasive visual web design.}

abstract = {Self-adaptive systems are fed with contextual information from the environments in which the systems operate,from within themselves, and from the users. Traditional self-adaptive systems research has focused on inputs of systems performance, resources, exception, and error recovery that drive systems' reaction to their environments. The intelligent ability ofthese self-adaptive systems is impoverished without knowledge ofa user's covert attention (thoughts, emotions, feelings). As a result, it is difficult to build effective systems that anticipate and react to users' needs as projected by covert behavior. This paperpresents the preliminary research results on capturing users'intention through neural input, and in reaction, commanding actions from software systems (e.g., load an application) based on human intention. Further, systems can self-adapt and refine their behaviors driven by such human covert behavior. The long-term research goal is to incorporate and synergize human neural input.Thus establishing software systems with a self-adaptive capability to "feel" and "anticipate" users intentions and put the human in the loop.},

@article{Ghezzi2013,
abstract = {Modern software systems are often characterized by uncertainty and changes in the environment in which they are embedded. Hence, they must be designed as adaptive systems. We propose a framework that supports adaptation to non-functional manifestations of uncertainty. Our framework allows engineers to derive, from an initial model of the system, a finite state automaton augmented with probabilities. The system is then executed by an interpreter that navigates the automaton and invokes the component implementations associated to the states it traverses. The interpreter adapts the execution by choosing among alternative possible paths of the automaton in order to maximize the system's ability to meet its non-functional requirements. To demonstrate the adaptation capabilities of the proposed approach we implemented an adaptive application inspired by an existing worldwide distributed mobile application and we discussed several adaptation scenarios.},

Emerging personal computing paradigms such as ubiquitous and mobile computing will benefit from better interoperability, as this is an enabler for a higher degree of automation of many tasks that would otherwise require the end-users' attention. Specific application areas of Semantic Web technologies with direct ramifications to these new paradigms include Web Services, context-awareness and policy modeling.",

pages="1197--1212",
abstract="Pervasive sensing has opened up new opportunities for measuring our feelings and understanding our behavior by monitoring our affective states while mobile. This review paper surveys pervasive affect sensing by examining and considering three major elements of affective pervasive systems, namely ``sensing,'' ``analysis,'' and ``application.'' Sensing investigates the different sensing modalities that are used in existing real-time affective applications, analysis explores different approaches to emotion recognition and visualization based on different types of collected data, and application investigates different leading areas of affective applications. For each of the three aspects, the paper includes an extensive survey of the literature and finally outlines some of challenges and future research opportunities of affective sensing in the context of pervasive computing.",

abstract="This paper presents a dynamically adaptive proximity controller (APC) to balance energy consumption and user comfort of computer screens in office environments. Our APC system detects desk activities, such as working with the computer screen (screen on) and being away (screen off) and controls screens accordingly. Ultra-sound range (USR) sensors were used to measure user proximity. To compensate for USR measurement errors, APC timing parameters were dynamically adapted and previous screen switch-off operations corrected using implicit user feedback. The feedback was obtained from proximity variance increases due to user movement following erroneous control operations. System performance and user comfort were evaluated in a real-life intervention study with 12 participants during 19 days. Detection accuracy was up to 98Â {\%}. Energy savings of up to 21Â {\%} were obtained by comparing intervention and baseline measurements. User responses showed that the APC system could yield energy savings, while maintaining user comfort when assessed using pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. The implicit feedback control is suitable to reduce system commissioning effort.",

abstract="As the population increases in the world, the ratio of health carers is rapidly decreasing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to create new technologies to monitor the physical and mental health of people during their daily life. In particular, negative mental states like depression and anxiety are big problems in modern societies, usually due to stressful situations during everyday activities including work. This paper presents a machine learning approach for stress detection on people using wearable physiological sensors with the final aim of improving their quality of life. The presented technique can monitor the state of the subject continuously and classify it into ''stressful'' or ''non-stressful'' situations. Our classification results show that this method is a good starting point towards real-time stress detection.",
